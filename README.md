# MapAdd
Standalone version of map edits from HEAT, ResMod, etc., to be used in any gameplay type OR for integration into your own mod.

Planned features:
- Levels not replacements by default, but main.xml's commented to show you how to make it a functioning replacement IN YOUR OWN MOD.
- Removal of unique MM key when above is done
- Addtl. edits
- Cleaner code
- Trash cleanup (yippee...)
